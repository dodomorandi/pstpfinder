    Created a fast frame counter
    
    It's a simple workaround: we take the atoms count as reference, then we get the second frame "step", we seek the last position of the file, search for the atoms count and get it's subsequential number (the step). This will give the number of frames.

    Lots of fixes. Now it should be quite stable.
    
    * Added getGroup in Gromacs class;
    * Added waitOperation;
    * SasAtomSerializable have been implemented completely inside SasAtom;
    * Added semaphore waiting system in SasAnalysis::operator >>;
    * Added control for empty circular buffer in SasAnalysis::operator >>. It should also work for EOF handling;
    * Added file status control in SasAnalysis::open;
    * FIXED: group selection now uses GROMACS snew instead of new[] operator;
    * FIXED: operator >> in SasAnalysis must return a reference to the class instance and accept a reference to SasAtom;
    * FIXED: using "protein" group for Pittpi operation instead of getAtomsCount -- it considers EVERY atom of the box;
    * FIXED: wrong loop condition;
    * FIXED: semaphore handling in SasAnalysis::operator >>. It must start with value 0 instead of bufferSemaphoreMax. Consequently different part of code have been changed to avoid semaphore problems;
    * FIXED: using curChunk in SasAnalysis::operator >> instead of popping from chunks;
    * FIXED: missing operationThread->wakeUp in SasAnalysis::operator >>;
    * FIXED: loadChunk(in) must be pushed, not assigned;
    * FIXED: loadChunk must use unsigned int instead of unsigned long;
    * FIXED: SasAtom size is nAtoms, not "size";

    Better GROMACS headers compatibility

    Couple of improvements + fix
    
    * Added "unknown" aminoacid
    * Added a translation system for uncommon aminoacid nomenclature (see Amber)
    * Changed behaviour for to access residues and atoms inside a protein object. Now every problem related to atom references should be fixed/avoided.
    * FIXED: using different AA index instead of AA type to determine a new aminoacid

    Implemented the protein in getAverageStructure
    
    * Changed from unsigned char to char for type in PdbAtom
    * Implemented type in Residue
    * Code refactoring for appendResidue. STILL DOESN'T WORK!
    * Protein is built inside __getAverageStructure
    
    There are still some problems around protein->atoms references. This is probably related to memory reallocation of residues vector. I still miss a simple way to handle realtime referencing in a safe way.

    Initial support for getAverageStructure + fixes
    
    * Moved rerefences to gromacs header files from Gromacs.h to Gromacs.cpp if unneeded there. Also removed C reference to these files, because I noticed they are C++ headers;
    * New method readNextX. It's a wrapper to gromacs read_next_x. The method should be version-indipendent and should close and reopen the trajectory when finished.
    * Initial getAverageStructure method. The Protein "building" is still missing, but average calculation should work
    * FIXED: area and surfacedots must be initializated;
    * FIXED: aminoacidLetter and aminoacidTriplet must be const

    * Changed a simple deallocation with Gromacs sfree. It seems to not work as the std free function...

    Changed default filename
    
    I wanted to use an unique session file, but this could need a rewrite of the class structure. I think I'll continue developing everything in splitted files, then, maybe in the future, I'll change everything and let the Gromacs class handle the unique file. Related class will have only a stream they use to read and write their "work". It's not easy because I need to write a particular device that doesn't allow to work outside particular buffer regions. Nowadays there are other priorities.

    Various fixes
    
    * Started using GLibmm
    * Migrating from executable classes to boost::bind to handle multithread in a better way
    * Now getTimeStep and getFrameStep use read_x_frame instead of read_x_xtc. It seems there was something wrong in memory handling, because GUI gave lots of errors
    * Better spinner handling. Now it's created only if it's missing and other controllers are hidden or disabled. There are still some problems that must be fixed
    * iteration() have been used in blocking mode while events_pending() is true
    * Now NewAnalysis::operator ()() is NewAnalysis::threadTrajectoryClicked()

    Support to get current frame number
    
    In Gromacs now the current frame number is saved (index-0 based) and can be asked usign getCurrentFrame(index-1 based -- it's the GROMACS' way!)
    Fixed the count number if a new trajectory is loaded
    Naturally the "current frame" variable is thread-safe!

    Started with multithread calculateSas
    
    An initial implementation to let calculateSas run indepentently from the GUI. This will allow to have a progressbar and details about "WTF is happening in background"

    Fixed some mutex-related problems
    
    Now the program flows correctly. Still don't know if it really works. Controls related to data integrity and auto-saving must be done.

    Rearranged Gromacs code
    
    Redistribuited some code in getTrajectory and getTopology. This allows to recall these codes later. It also allow to run some procedures outside calculateSas.
    oenv has again a class-wide scope (with LOTS of other variables!).

    Saving system based on boost libs
    
    A simple system for data dumping have been implemented using boost serialization and iostreams (for zlib compression).
    This system is not architecture-portable, because of the width of basic data structures and endianess. Maybe a day I will write a filter to convert also data endianess.

    C Exception handler object
    
    Simple to use: initialize it inside a scope where you think the library could segfault, than destroy it. If a sigsegv is catched the function will print an error and terminate the program.

    A couple of changes
    
    * It's possible (and easy) to get atom coordinates and sas
    * Removed one useless index
    * bDGSol always false. For now we don't calculate it -- I really don't know what can I do with DGSol value...

    Added memory deallocation; new sas target approach
    
    Now memory should be handled correctly in calculateSas.
    A dynamic way for SAS targeting have been added. There's no way to handle it for now -- it's simply initialized inside Gromacs::init() function.

    This is completely taken from gmx_sas.c. Lots of changes must be done. First of all a dynamic way to handle atom indexes must be written. Then we have to work on data saving. A hybrid disk/ram handling would be great.

    * Added namespace for everything regarding GROMACS
    * Now output_env_t is handled directly by the calculateSas method
    * calculateSas have been started. We need to implement things from sas_plot
