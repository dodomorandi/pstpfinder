    Fixed problem with concatenated trajectories
    
    A very huge bug still exists, but for now I have no idea how to solve it.
    When trajectories are concatenated it is possible to change the frame "time parameter" to transform two dynamics 1-10;1-6 in one dynamic 1-16. This commit allows to analyse these kind of concatenated dynamics if the timestep is constant. If not so, or if the time parameter is left unchanged I have no idea how to distinguish this kind of trajectory from a "normal" one. And the program hangs.

    Bug introduced in commit b63d29a7e3f8953f3dbad28ec336b204a7547c1c because of the output of read_first_frame, which is a boolean and not the number of atoms read.

    Changed Gromacs "copy" constructor
    
    In fact is not possible to really copy the object: a possible open stream could lead to mutex deadlock. It is safer to rebuild everything and copy only "static" data like filenames and others.

    Also added the "complete" parameter. I'll need it soon to let the "user" (Gromacs, SasAnalysis and others) to check if a MetaStream have been completely written of a piece is missing and must be resumed.

    Changed how Session_Base handles files
    
    * SessionFile is now a unique_ptr
    * Session doesn't have to pass a ios_base::openmode parameter to Session_Base. Note that now a Session<ofstream> opens a file in 'w' mode, Session<ifstream> in 'r' mode and Session<fstream> in 'r+' mode.
    * Session<fstream> also calls prepareForWrite
    * Other minor changes

    * A couple of function (including constructors) added to PdbAtom and Residue. Now it'd be better handling unknown Atoms and Residues.

    Lots of changes related to session handling
    
    * Session class have been completely rewritten. Now it can handle input and output streams. A version number have been implemented. It uses the new Serializer class instead of directly dumping/reading data to/from streams. However the compatibility have been completely broken and old session files can't be used anymore.
    * SasAtom now uses Serializer class instead of the boost::archive
    * Protein now can dump PDB to file and to stream. It now uses C++ streams to dump (but still loads using C FILEs)
    * SasAnalysis have been modified to use Serializer instead of boost::archive
    * NewAnalysis.cpp have been modified so it can handle easily session files
    * Now a valid session file must be specified ("temporary" session file is not written anymore)
    * Gromacs now has getTrajectoryFile and getTopologyFile
    * BOOST_SERIALIZATION and BOOST_IOSTREAMS are not needed anymore in configure.ac
    * Code cleaning (just a bit)

    This class must be used instead of boost::serialization. This kind of change is needed due to MetaStream compatibility with boost libraries.
    Also some endianess check have been done. Maybe some day I could make the session file completely portable...

    * Added two callbacks and changed from event* to callback*
    * Destructor try to call MetaStream_Base::close before calling callbackDestroy
    * Now MetaStream_Base can handle standard manipulators
    * Changed how is calculated the number of added bytes in operator<<
    * Don't call T::operator<< but cast from MetaStream_Base to T and use the "<<" operator (allows easier handling of "std::operator<<")
    * Added MetaStream_Base::close
    * Removed useless debugging features in MetaStream (I though they could help me... but I was wrong!)
    * Changed from stream_utils.h to utils.h (It will handle other utils)
    * FIX: streamType initialization bug
    * FIX: missing return value in operator>>
    * FIX: possible writtenBytes < 0
    * FIX: streamEnd didn't change in MetaStream::write
    
    Note: "New Analysis" still doesn't work. Wait for a couple of commits.

    Session is now a template class
    
    This modification allow to handle MetaStream and sessions in a more dynamic way. Now if we need a read-only session, we can use a Session<ifstream>, when a read-write session is needed a Session<fstream> can be declared. Notice that this "little" change brings to a different handling of other classes like Gromacs and SasAnalysis. In fact SasAnalysis is now a template class too, and Gromacs handles ofstreams (with Session<ofstream>) when calculateSas is called. Everything could be done thanks to MetaStream.

    Metastream has been rewritten
    
    It work in a completely different way. Now a template class MetaStream_Base can handle every kind of stream derived from basic_istream and basic_ostream, but the user have to use MetaStream class as before. This because the class have to contruct itself using different kind of methods for different kind of class inheritance (if a MetaStream<ifstream> is declared, the class will have to use tellg() and seekg(), if MetaStream<ofstream> is used then it will need tellp() and seekp()). This brings to different method specializations, and simply because I can't specialize a method in an unspecialized template class, MetaStream<T> needs to inherit MetaStream_Base<T>. Notice that MetaStream_Base<T> derives from T, but basic_istream and basic_ostream methods can't be explictly overridden inside MetaStream_Base (they won't necessarly exist). That's why, for debugging purposes, some virtual methods are declared directly in MetaStream, and in this way they should be able to being debugged. I put them in a #ifdef NDEBUG scope because they add a little overhead (I think).

    Changed how Gromacs include path is handled
    
    Now we need to use "#include <gromacs/something.h" instead of "#include <something.h>". This because there are some files (like assert.h) that also exists in Gromacs include path. I also needed to define _assert_h to allow normal assert.h inclusion. What can I say? Keep It Simple, Stupid! Call it gromacs_assert.h!! Damn...

    Changed MetaStream behaviour
    
    Now MetaStream is a template class. A complete implementation is needed to let it work with basic_iostream, but it will be done soon. Oh, naturally everything inside MetaStream.cpp have been removed and put inside the header file, because of the problem related to template classes and file splitting. For now I simply changed implementations from MetaStream to MetaStream<ifstream>, but I want to change Session behaviour, so it can be used also to write session files.

    Results window improvements
    
    I worked quite a lot with this, without success. My idea was to
    overlay a "property toolbox" over the graph when the cursor was on
    a bar. I tried to make a new Container in which a cairo context
    could be used to draw something, but I was unable to put child
    widgets on top. I also tried to use GooCanvas library, but when
    everything worked well with a simple button, I noticed that it wont
    be the same for something more complicated (in fact I've been warned
    about limitation of Goocanvas::Widget, but I didn't understand
    if it could fit my needs). I've spent too much time in this problem,
    now I simply added a HPaned and put some Pocket information in the
    second child. I don't like that, but for now I think it's the best
    solution. When Ubuntu and derived distributions will be using
    Gtk >= 3.2 I could -- maybe -- implement Overlay to obtain what I
    wanted.

    Using pointers to MetaStream instead of objects
    
    I've never thought that if I use something like:
    
    A& A::operator =(const A& a)
    {
      a->~A();
      new (this) A(a.somearg); // Or also with the copy constructor
      return *this;
    }
    
    ...
    
    A a; // Using the empty constructor
    ...
    a = A(somearg);
    
    ...then I call firstly the empty constructor A, then two times the A(somearg) constructor. It's a waste of resource, then it's better using a pointer to the object if I can't initialize it inside the class initialization.

    Created a fast frame counter
    
    It's a simple workaround: we take the atoms count as reference, then we get the second frame "step", we seek the last position of the file, search for the atoms count and get it's subsequential number (the step). This will give the number of frames.

    Lots of fixes. Now it should be quite stable.
    
    * Added getGroup in Gromacs class;
    * Added waitOperation;
    * SasAtomSerializable have been implemented completely inside SasAtom;
    * Added semaphore waiting system in SasAnalysis::operator >>;
    * Added control for empty circular buffer in SasAnalysis::operator >>. It should also work for EOF handling;
    * Added file status control in SasAnalysis::open;
    * FIXED: group selection now uses GROMACS snew instead of new[] operator;
    * FIXED: operator >> in SasAnalysis must return a reference to the class instance and accept a reference to SasAtom;
    * FIXED: using "protein" group for Pittpi operation instead of getAtomsCount -- it considers EVERY atom of the box;
    * FIXED: wrong loop condition;
    * FIXED: semaphore handling in SasAnalysis::operator >>. It must start with value 0 instead of bufferSemaphoreMax. Consequently different part of code have been changed to avoid semaphore problems;
    * FIXED: using curChunk in SasAnalysis::operator >> instead of popping from chunks;
    * FIXED: missing operationThread->wakeUp in SasAnalysis::operator >>;
    * FIXED: loadChunk(in) must be pushed, not assigned;

    Better GROMACS headers compatibility
    
    They use a signed index for residues. Changed behaviour for coherence.

Author: Edoardo Morandi <morandidodo@gmail.com>
Date:   Fri May 6 13:20:14 2011 +0200

    Couple of improvements + fix
    
    * Added "unknown" aminoacid
    * Added a translation system for uncommon aminoacid nomenclature (see Amber)
    * Changed behaviour for to access residues and atoms inside a protein object. Now every problem related to atom references should be fixed/avoided.
    * FIXED: using different AA index instead of AA type to determine a new aminoacid

Date:   Thu May 5 19:03:19 2011 +0200

    Implemented the protein in getAverageStructure
    
    * Changed from unsigned char to char for type in PdbAtom
    * Implemented type in Residue
    * Code refactoring for appendResidue. STILL DOESN'T WORK!
    * Protein is built inside __getAverageStructure
    
    There are still some problems around protein->atoms references. This is probably related to memory reallocation of residues vector. I still miss a simple way to handle realtime referencing in a safe way.

    Initial support for getAverageStructure + fixes
    
    * Moved rerefences to gromacs header files from Gromacs.h to Gromacs.cpp if unneeded there. Also removed C reference to these files, because I noticed they are C++ headers;
    * New method readNextX. It's a wrapper to gromacs read_next_x. The method should be version-indipendent and should close and reopen the trajectory when finished.
    * Initial getAverageStructure method. The Protein "building" is still missing, but average calculation should work
    * FIXED: area and surfacedots must be initializated;
    * FIXED: aminoacidLetter and aminoacidTriplet must be const

    * Changed a simple deallocation with Gromacs sfree. It seems to not work as the std free function...

    Changed default filename
    
    I wanted to use an unique session file, but this could need a rewrite of the class structure. I think I'll continue developing everything in splitted files, then, maybe in the future, I'll change everything and let the Gromacs class handle the unique file. Related class will have only a stream they use to read and write their "work". It's not easy because I need to write a particular device that doesn't allow to work outside particular buffer regions. Nowadays there are other priorities.

    Various fixes
    
    * Started using GLibmm
    * Migrating from executable classes to boost::bind to handle multithread in a better way
    * Now getTimeStep and getFrameStep use read_x_frame instead of read_x_xtc. It seems there was something wrong in memory handling, because GUI gave lots of errors
    * Better spinner handling. Now it's created only if it's missing and other controllers are hidden or disabled. There are still some problems that must be fixed
    * iteration() have been used in blocking mode while events_pending() is true
    * Now NewAnalysis::operator ()() is NewAnalysis::threadTrajectoryClicked()

    Support to get current frame number
    
    In Gromacs now the current frame number is saved (index-0 based) and can be asked usign getCurrentFrame(index-1 based -- it's the GROMACS' way!)
    Fixed the count number if a new trajectory is loaded
    Naturally the "current frame" variable is thread-safe!

    A simple system for data dumping have been implemented using boost serialization and iostreams (for zlib compression).
    This system is not architecture-portable, because of the width of basic data structures and endianess. Maybe a day I will write a filter to convert also data endianess.
